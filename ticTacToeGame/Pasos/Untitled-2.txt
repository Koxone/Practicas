Step-by-step, I'll need to:

1. **Handle Player Selection:** Add event listeners to the X and O toggles in index.html, store the player's choice, and start the game with O.

2. **Initialize Game Variables:** currentPlayer starts as O. gameBoard array tracks cell states.

3. **Cell Interactions:** On hover, show the outline of the currentPlayer's symbol. On click, place the symbol if the cell is empty, update gameBoard, check for win/draw, switch turns.

4. **Update Turn Indicator:** Toggle visibility of the X or O SVG in the header based on currentPlayer.

5. **Check for Win/Draw:** Use the winConditions array to check if currentPlayer has won. If all cells filled with no winner, it's a draw.

6. **End Game Handling:** Show the appropriate end screen (win or draw), update scores, handle quit/next round actions.

7. **Reset Functionality:** Clear the board, reset variables, hide end screens.
